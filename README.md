# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
	The Kickstarter project is designed to help Louise evaluate how her play fever launch date and fundraising compared to other theater plays. We’ll take a deep dive into the data to show by month their success, failed and canceled rates along with breaking out fundraising goals. This will help Louise build her strategy by identifying the right time of year to launch a play and what’s the right budget targets to increase Louise’s chances of being successful and making a profit.

### Purpose
The goal is to use the data to identify what worked well, what were the opportunities for improvement, and the best timing to launch plays. These data sets will help Louise set realistic fundraising targets along with identifying the best months for launching her plays. We’ll look at both what the fundraising outcomes faired to their goals and when’s the best time of year to launch a play to increase its changes of being successful. 

## Analysis and Challenges
For the launch date analysis I took the following approach. I first created a pivot table utilizing the data set on the Kickstarter tab. Then by moving the parent category and years into he filter section I was able to drill down and show only data for the Theater parent category showing all years. Then I dropped the outcomes in the columns, Date created conversation in the rows section and last dropped the count of outcomes in the Values section. This allowed me to see only Theater fundraiser results broken out by successful, cancel and failed by month. Then I added a pivot line chart to show the data in a format that would allow me to tell the story of what months have the highest success rates and which months to avoid.

For the fundraising outcomes date analysis I took the following approach. I created a new sheet utilizing the countIf formula to create a table showing the total number of successful, failed and canceled plays based on their goals results. Then I totaled them up and broke out the percentage based on goal dollar ranges and showed it by successful, canceled and failed. This then allowed me to create a line graph showing the percentage on the Y axes, dollar amount ranges on the X axes and trend the data out. This allowed me to show what target ranges would increase the chances of creating a successful fundraiser vs an unsuccessful one. It allows helps you set your budget targets as well.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For me my greatest challenge was not over thinking my countIf formulas. My first approach I was trying to build a long and complicated formula. After some google searching and looking though my Excel books at home I was able to simplify my approach and finalize the formulas. Then it allowed me to cross reference what my data set produce to what was in our class Module 1 Kickstarter assignment instructions.

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?


- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
